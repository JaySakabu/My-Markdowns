# So  you don't like my taste in films or music

It's fine, I'm not hurt ~~too much~~

I read a lot of things, so here I'll share some of what I've read in the past couple years, maybe you'll fall down the same rabbit holes I did!

### CRISPR, technology to edit genomes
Read: [this](https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html) probably [this too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR)

**Summary**: CRISPR is technology that can edit genes, if you think that sounds insane: it is. It can target specific bits of DNA in a cell and change it. It's been theorized that it may be capable of ending cancer. The full extent of the technology has yet to be seen though.

### Deep Fakes used in films
Read: [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2020/12/23/star-wars-fan-fixes-that-crazy-mandalorian-cameo-with-a-stellar-deepfake/?sh=50044666d5df) and check [this out while you're at it!](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-furious-7-brought-late-845763)

**Summary**: Deep fakes have taken the internet's interest by storm. But they've been used for a while now in films. In 2013, Paul Walker passed away during filming of the _Fast and Furious 7_ and in order to send his character off, the CGI team used Walker's brother and technology to put Walker's face onto his brother's. This technology was again used in the Disney+ series, _The Mandalorian_ to bring a young Mark Hamill back onto the screen. 

Just a few articles and things that have piqued my interest lately. Plenty more, maybe this'll get updated sometime. But for now: [Head back to the readme!](README.md)
