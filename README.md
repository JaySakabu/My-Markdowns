First a little introduction, my name's Jay Sakabu and I'm a junior in Information Technology at the University of Missouri-Columbia.

Here, I'll showcases some features of markdown and also share some things I like. **Enjoy your stay**, or _don't_, your choice!

Big fan of movies, don't judge my taste but these are some of the [greats](Movies.md)
